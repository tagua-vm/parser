//! Tagua VM
//!
//! Tagua VM is an experimental [PHP](http://php.net/) Virtual Machine written
//! with [the Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [the LLVM Compiler
//! Infrastructure](http://llvm.org/).
//!
//! This library contains lexical and syntactic analysers, aka the parser,
//! for the PHP language.
//!
//! This is a parser combinator. The immediate consequence is that the lexical
//! and syntax analyzers form a monolithic algorithm. The organization is the
//! following:
//!
//!   * The `tokens` module declares all the lexemes,
//!   * The `rules` module declares the grammar as a set of rules,
//!   * The `ast` module contains the structure that will constitute the AST.
//!
//! The parser is based on [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom). nom is a parser
//! combinator library with a focus on safe parsing, streaming patterns, and as
//! much as possible zero copy. We try to enforce the zero copy property to
//! hold.

/// Complete parsing of a datum starting by the sentence symbol of the grammar.
///
/// The grammar is a set of rules. By definition, it has a sentence symbol,
/// also called the root rule. The `parse` function will lex, parse and produce
/// the associated AST of the `input` datum.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use taguavm::language::parser;
///
/// let expression = b"1+2";
/// parser::parse(&expression[..]);
/// ```
